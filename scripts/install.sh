RESH SEARCH APPLICATION = Redesigned reverse search that actually works

    >>> Launch RESH SEARCH app by pressing CTRL+R <<<
    (you will need to restart your terminal first)
     
    Search your history by commands. 
    Host, directories, git remote, and exit status is used to display relevant results first.

    At first, the search application will use the standard shell history without context. 
    All history recorded from now on will have context which will be used by the RESH SEARCH app.

    Enable/disable Ctrl+R binding using reshctl command:
     $ reshctl enable ctrl_r_binding
     $ reshctl disable ctrl_r_binding

CHECK FOR UPDATES
    To check for (and install) updates use reshctl command:
     $ reshctl update

HISTORY
    Your resh history will be recorded to '~/.resh_history.json'
    Look at it using e.g. following command (you might need to install jq)
     $ tail -f ~/.resh_history.json | jq

ISSUES & FEEDBACK
    Please report issues to: https://github.com/curusarn/resh/issues
    Feedback and suggestions are very welcome!
